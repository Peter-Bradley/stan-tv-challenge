This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Getting Started with Application
- Get Latest Version of NodeJS
- Get Lastest Version of Git
- Open a Command Window
- Clone repository via `git clone https://github.com/Wargamers117/stan-tv-challenge.git`
- Enter into the cloned folder in the command window via `cd stan-tv-challenge`
- run `npm install` in the command window
- run `npm start` in the command window

The application will now start a local instance of the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Running application unit tests
- Open a Command Window
- Enter into the application folder location
- run `npm test` in the command window

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### Building the application for production
- Open a Command Window
- Enter into the application folder location
- run `npm run build` in the command window

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Technical and architecture decisions
- I utilised Redux in addition to react to enable easy management of the application state
- Styled Components allows for easier code to read, along with allowing minimizing code files for simpler maintenance
- React Router allows for simple implementation of routing between pages, and would allow for more to be 

### Improvements that I'd liked to implement
- Selecting types of programs displayed via links on top of screen
- Better CSS formatting for the program page
- Better unit testing (Implement a mock store)
- Change the build output file names to correctly align with the task file names

### Things to do differently if more allocated time
- Make use of preimplemented packages for the carosuel
